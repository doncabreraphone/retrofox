## UP FOR COFFEE?
The one thing that you'll love about Buenos Aires is coffee.  We have literally hundreds of unique coffee shops around town. From specialty coffee to keto bakeries and high-protein options for your post-workout fix, the choices are endless. Imagine an old nuns' abbey turned into a coffee place or a caf√© inside a Russian church. We even have Turkish coffee heated on sand. There are so many options, it's impossible to explore them all by yourself. 
Like any dev, I love coffee, and I take any chance to buy a fellow dev a cup. Let me treat you to one of the best spots in Buenos Aires. Breakfast is on me!
